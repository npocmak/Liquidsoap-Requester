    This is the (tentative) configuration file for the public release of Quinn
    Ebert's Liquidsoap Requester PHP Web-based Application.  Despite
    the file extension, it is a PHP code-style file.  If you know what
    this means, it means you can treat it as a PHP file (you can do *really*
    fancy stuff with it, if you know what you're doing)!
    --------------------------------------------------
    If you're unfamiliar with PHP, or very short on time, just follow these
    comments to setup your LSR installation...
